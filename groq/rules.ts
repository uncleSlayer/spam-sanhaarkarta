    - No inappropriate virtual backgrounds, profile pictures or usernames in voice/video channels.

    6. GitHub Integration
    - Members must link their GitHub account and set their server nickname to match their GitHub username for transparency.

    - No posting memes, jokes or non-constructive content in serious channels like #coding, #architecture etc.
    - Voice channels have specific use-cases assigned by staff - check the channel topic before joining.

    8. Staff Instructions
    - Follow all instructions from server admins, moderators and staff without question or pushback. Failure to comply may result in penalties.
    - Do not mention staff unnecessarily or question staff decisions publicly. Use the appropriate channels to appeal moderator actions respectfully.

    9. Outside Interactions
    - Members are expected to uphold the server's principles of respect and professionalism in all external interactions involving the community. 
    - Violations of this code of conduct or tarnishing the community's reputation externally may result in disciplinary action.

    - Any attempt to circumvent punishments or fair Process may lead to further penalties.

    Members are expected to understand and follow all these rules meticulously to maintain the integrity of our elite software engineering community. Ignorance of any rule is not an excuse for violations. The server staff's decisions are final and any form of rules-lawyering or rules-circumvention attempts are unacceptable.
